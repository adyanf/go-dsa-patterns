Two Pointers Pattern

The two pointers pattern is a versatile technique used in problem-solving to efficiently
traverse or manipulate sequential data structures, such as arrays, strings, or linked lists.
It involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner,
typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions.
These pointers dynamically adjust based on specific conditions or criteria, allowing for the efficient
exploration of the data and enabling solutions with optimal time and space complexity.
Whenever thereâ€™s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition,
the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

The implementation depends on the problem, but common variations include:
1. Opposite Ends: One pointer starts at the beginning (left) and the other at the
   end (right). They move towards each other until they meet or cross. This is
   useful for problems involving sorted arrays, like finding a pair with a specific sum.
2. Same Direction (Fast & Slow): Both pointers start at or near the beginning, but
   one (the "fast" pointer) moves ahead of the other (the "slow" pointer). This is
   often used for cycle detection in linked lists, finding the middle element, or
   processing elements in a window.
3. Different Start, Same Direction: Pointers might start at different positions
   (e.g., one at index 0, one at index k) and move in the same direction to compare
   or process elements that are a fixed distance apart.

Use this pattern when all of these conditions are fulfilled:
1. Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
2. Process pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
3. Dynamic pointer movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria.
   In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.

Common use cases include:
- Finding a pair in a sorted array that sums to a target value.
- Reversing an array or string in-place.
- Checking for palindromes.
- Removing duplicates from a sorted array.
- Cycle detection in linked lists (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm).
- Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

The primary benefit of the two pointers pattern is its efficiency. It can often
reduce the time complexity of a problem from a brute-force O(n^2) (using nested loops)
down to O(n) (using a single pass with two pointers). It also typically uses O(1)
extra space, making it very memory-efficient.
